# Game Programming Projects

Welcome to my Game Programming Projects that have been produced by creating my own game engine! This repository contains a collection of game projects developed using the OpenGL Library in C++.

## Overview

This repository serves as a showcase of my game programming projects from CS3113 - Introduction to Game Programming. Each project is housed in its respective directory, containing source code, assets, and documentation.

## Projects

### [Project 1: Simple 2D Scene](./simple_2d_scene)

This first project encapsulates basic concepts and establishes groundwork for future projects. Topics explored in this project includes: delta time, matrix translation, matrix rotation, and matrix scaling. The two sprites are from a video game call **Stardew Valley**, it is one of my favorite games to play.

### [Project 2: Pong Clone](./pong_clone)

This second project incorporates two important topics in game engineering and design: user input and collision. To practice with these concepts, this assigment asked the programmers to imitate the classic game of pong. To style it into my own version of pong, I designed the game around one of my favorite music groups, **LE SSERAFIM**. Some features in this game include having 1 Player and 2 Player game modes by pressing t and having up to 3 balls in play by pressing 1, 2, or 3.

## Exercises

### [Exercise 1: Player Input](./player_input)

This first exercise establishes player input through the keyboard. This allows the up, down, left, and right keys to move a sprite along the screen. By pressing r, we can rotate the sprite clockwise along the z-axis, if c is pressed, the sprite would then rotate counter-clockwise, and pressing s would stop any rotation along the z-axis.

### [Exercise 2: Animation](./animation)

This exercise establishes an understanding of animation through the use of a sprite sheet. By having a sprite sheet of 4 sonic characters, the sprites on the screen rotate through these 4 characters until the user presses the s button. This would stop the rotation through each character and one character would be chosen.
