# Game Programming Projects

Welcome to my Game Programming Projects! This repository contains a collection of game projects developed using OpenGL in C++.

## Table of Contents
- [Project 1: [Simple 2D Scene]](./simple_2d_scene)

## Overview

This repository serves as a showcase of my game programming projects from CS3113 - Introduction to Game Programming. Each project is housed in its respective directory, containing source code, assets, and documentation.

## Projects

### [Project 1: Simple 2D Scene](./simple_2d_scene)

This first project encapsulates basic concepts and establishes groundwork for future projects. Topics explored in this project includes: delta time, matrix translation, matrix rotation, and matrix scaling. The two sprites are from a video game call **Stardew Valley**, it is one of my favorite games to play.

## Exercises

### [Exercise 1: Player Input](./player_input)

This first exercise establishes player input through the keyboard. This allows the up, down, left, and right keys to move a sprite along the screen. By pressing r, we can rotate the sprite clockwise along the z-axis, if c is pressed, the sprite would then rotate counter-clockwise, and pressing s would stop any rotation along the z-axis.
