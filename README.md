## Projects

### [Project 1: Simple 2D Scene](./simple_2d_scene)

This first project encapsulates basic concepts and establishes groundwork for future projects. Topics explored in this project includes: delta time, matrix translation, matrix rotation, and matrix scaling. The two sprites are from a video game call **Stardew Valley**, it is one of my favorite games to play.
